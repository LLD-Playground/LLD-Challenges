# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 🚀

The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** states that a class should have **only one reason to change**. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or purpose, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## 📌 Why is SRP Important?
- **Improves code maintainability** by reducing complexity.
- **Enhances readability** by keeping class functionality focused.
- **Simplifies debugging and testing** by limiting responsibilities.
- **Encourages reusability** by separating concerns.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In many applications, classes often handle multiple responsibilities, leading to **tight coupling** and making code harder to modify. Your task is to **refactor a given class** that violates SRP into multiple focused classes, ensuring each has a **single responsibility**.

For a detailed explanation and starter code, refer to **`single_responsibility.ipynb`**.

## 🚀 How to Solve?
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `single_responsibility.ipynb`
2. Follow through the instructions and run the notebook.
