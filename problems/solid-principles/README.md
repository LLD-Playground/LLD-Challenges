# SOLID Principles 🚀

**SOLID** is a set of five design principles aimed at writing maintainable and scalable object-oriented software. These principles help in creating software that is easier to understand, modify, and extend.

## 📌 What are the SOLID Principles?
1. **S** - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **O** - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **L** - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes should be replaceable by their base types without altering correctness.
4. **I** - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **D** - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## 🎯 Why Use SOLID?
- Enhances **code readability** and maintainability.
- Encourages **scalability** and **reusability**.
- Reduces **tight coupling** between components.
- Helps in **avoiding code smells** and anti-patterns.

## 🚀 How to Practice?
1. Explore the `/solid-principles` directory for individual principle examples.
2. Each principle has its own folder with a **problem statement** and **starter code**.
3. Implement the missing parts following SOLID guidelines.
4. Follow the instructions to validate your solution.
