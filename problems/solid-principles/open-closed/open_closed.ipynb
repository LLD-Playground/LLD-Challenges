    "## Detailed Analysis (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "By refactoring our bad code, we now have a **more flexible, maintainable, and scalable** solution. Let‚Äôs break down why this approach is superior:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Closed for Modification, Open for Extension  \n",
    "- Once we define the core system, **we never have to modify existing code** when adding new functionality.  \n",
    "- Instead of adding more `if-elif` conditions, we can introduce new payment methods without touching the core logic.  \n",
    "- This reduces the risk of introducing **unexpected bugs** when making changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Easier to Maintain  \n",
    "- If a bug arises in one payment method, we only need to **fix that specific implementation**, not worry about affecting the entire payment system.  \n",
    "- Each payment method is **self-contained**, making it easier for developers to debug and update.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Code is More Readable and Organized  \n",
    "- Instead of a **long, cluttered function**, our logic is now **split into smaller, well-defined components**.  \n",
    "- Future developers can easily **understand and modify** the code without sifting through unnecessary details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Supports Future Growth Without Rework  \n",
    "- Suppose we later introduce **discounts, international fees, or dynamic pricing rules**‚Äîwe can add new features without modifying the existing codebase.  \n",
    "- This future-proofing ensures the system can **scale smoothly as new requirements emerge**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reduces the Risk of Errors  \n",
    "- When modifying a long function with multiple conditions, it‚Äôs easy to **accidentally break something**.  \n",
    "- By keeping each responsibility **separate**, we minimize the risk of unintentionally affecting other parts of the code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Encourages Reusability  \n",
    "- If another part of the application needs to calculate **payment fees**, we can reuse the logic without duplicating code.  \n",
    "- This ensures **consistency across the system** and avoids unnecessary redundancy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ The Bottom Line  \n",
