    "## 🔹 Small Example (Bad vs. Good Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚫 Bad Example: Violating LSP\n",
    "Imagine a program that models birds. We have a base class `Bird` and a subclass `Penguin`:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This bird is flying!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Penguin(Bird):\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"Penguins cannot fly!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **❌ What's Wrong Here?**\n",
    "- A `Penguin` **is a** `Bird`, but it **does not follow the behavior** expected from `Bird`.  \n",
    "- If our program calls `fly()` on any `Bird`, it **expects all birds to be able to fly**.  \n",
    "- Using `Penguin` as a `Bird` **breaks the program** because `Penguin.fly()` raises an exception!  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Good Example: Following LSP\n",
    "Instead of forcing **all birds to have a `fly()` method**, we **separate flying and non-flying birds** into different classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This bird is making a sound!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class FlyingBird(Bird):\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This bird is flying!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Penguin(Bird):  # Penguin is still a Bird, but doesn't inherit 'fly'\n",
    "    def swim(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This penguin is swimming!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **✅ Why is This Better?**\n",
    "- **Now, a `Penguin` can be used anywhere a `Bird` is expected, without breaking behavior.**  \n",
    "- The `fly()` method is only present in `FlyingBird`, so non-flying birds **don't have unexpected behavior**.  \n",
    "- The code is **cleaner, more logical, and respects real-world constraints**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Why Does LSP Matter?\n",
    "1️⃣ **Prevents Bugs** – Unexpected behavior (like a penguin \"flying\") won't crash the system.  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Improves Maintainability** – Easier to extend without breaking existing code.  \n",
    "3️⃣ **Makes Code More Predictable** – Every subclass behaves as expected when used in place of its parent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "LSP ensures that inheritance **makes sense** and that all subclasses **truly follow the contract** of their parent class. 🚀"

    "## Detailed Analysis (Optional)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have refactored the **bad code** to follow the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**, let’s analyze why this approach is better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 1️⃣ Prevents Unexpected Behavior & Runtime Errors  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🚫 Bad Code (Violating LSP)**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This bird is flying!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Penguin(Bird):\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"Penguins cannot fly!\")  # ❌ This breaks LSP!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **❌ What’s Wrong Here?**\n",
    "- The `Penguin` class is a subclass of `Bird`, so it **inherits all behaviors** of `Bird`.  \n",
    "- But **Penguins can’t fly**, so calling `penguin.fly()` **raises an exception**.  \n",
    "- Any function that expects a `Bird` and calls `fly()` will crash if it gets a `Penguin`!  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **💥 Real-World Impact**\n",
    "Imagine a function that makes birds fly: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def make_bird_fly(bird: Bird):\n",
    "    bird.fly()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using it like this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sparrow = Bird()\n",
    "penguin = Penguin()\n",
    "\n",
    "make_bird_fly(sparrow)  # ✅ Works fine\n",
    "make_bird_fly(penguin)  # ❌ Runtime error! Penguins cannot fly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **With good design, this issue won’t happen**—every subclass will work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2️⃣ Improves Code Maintainability & Scalability  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Good Code (Following LSP)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This bird is making a sound!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class FlyingBird(Bird):  \n",

    "        print(\"This bird is flying!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Penguin(Bird):  \n",
    "    def swim(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This penguin is swimming!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Why is This Better?\n",
    "- **Penguins don't inherit `fly()` anymore**—so there’s no chance of an exception!  \n",
    "- The program **doesn’t break when using different bird types**.  \n",
    "- **Future-Proofing:** If we add an `Ostrich` class, we simply **don’t include `fly()`** rather than overriding it with an error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: No Unexpected Failures**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_bird_abilities(bird: Bird):\n",
    "    bird.make_sound()\n",
    "    if isinstance(bird, FlyingBird):\n",
    "        bird.fly()\n",
    "    elif isinstance(bird, Penguin):\n",

    "\n",
    "sparrow = FlyingBird()\n",
    "penguin = Penguin()\n",
    "\n",
    "test_bird_abilities(sparrow)  # ✅ Works fine\n",
    "test_bird_abilities(penguin)  # ✅ Works fine\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ **No exceptions, no broken behavior—just clean, predictable code!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3️⃣ Ensures Subclasses Truly Follow Parent Class Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "LSP states that **if a subclass replaces a superclass, the program should still work as expected**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good Code:**  \n",
    "- Every `FlyingBird` can **fly**—so the `fly()` method is always valid.  \n",
    "- Every `Penguin` can **swim**—so it correctly extends `Bird` **without breaking the system**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**🚀 Result: Code behaves consistently!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 4️⃣ Encourages a Logical & Modular Design  \n",
    "\n",
    "By refactoring our code:  \n",
    "✅ We separate responsibilities clearly:  \n",
    "   - **Flying birds have `fly()`**  \n",
    "   - **Non-flying birds (like penguins) don’t inherit unnecessary methods**  \n",
    "✅ The system is **modular**—each class represents a well-defined concept.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we need to add **more bird types** later, we don’t modify existing code—we **extend it cleanly**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 5️⃣ Avoids the Need for Workarounds & Conditionals  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **bad code**, we'd need ugly workarounds like:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "if isinstance(bird, Penguin):\n",
    "    print(\"This bird can't fly.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    bird.fly()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This **violates the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**—we should be able to extend behavior without modifying existing code!  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **With the good design, no conditionals are needed.** Each class behaves correctly by design!  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Final Takeaway  \n",
    "\n",
    "By following the **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**, we achieve:  \n",
    "✅ **Predictable Behavior** – Subclasses **never break** the expected functionality of the parent class.  \n",
    "✅ **Scalability** – We can easily **add new bird types** without modifying existing logic.  \n",
    "✅ **Maintainability** – Clear, modular structure that is **easy to debug and extend**.  \n",
    "✅ **Logical Inheritance** – Every class behaves **exactly as expected** in all situations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Key Learning:** If a subclass **overrides a method** in a way that **changes how the parent class behaves**, it likely **violates LSP**. Instead, structure your classes to ensure **substituting a child class doesn’t break the program**! 🚀\n",

    "## 📝 Practice Problem: Ensuring Substitutability in a Payment System  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Scenario  \n",
    "\n",
    "You are a **Software Engineer at a FinTech company**, working on a **payment processing system**. The company supports multiple payment methods like **Credit Cards, PayPal, and Cryptocurrency**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your team has implemented a base class `PaymentProcessor`, and different subclasses for each payment method. However, **recent bug reports** indicate that the system crashes when switching between different payment types. Your task is to **refactor the code to ensure that new payment methods can be added seamlessly without breaking the system**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **🚨 Existing Code (Bad Design)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PaymentProcessor:\n",
    "    def process_payment(self, amount):\n",
    "        raise NotImplementedError(\"This method should be overridden in subclasses\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class CreditCardProcessor(PaymentProcessor):\n",
    "    def process_payment(self, amount):\n",

    "    def process_payment(self, amount):\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"Crypto payments require extra verification!\")  # ❌ Breaks LSP!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🚨 What's Wrong?**\n",
    "1. **The CryptoProcessor class violates LSP** – calling `process_payment()` on a `PaymentProcessor` should always work, but it **throws an exception**.  \n",
    "2. **Unexpected behavior when using different payment methods** – Some payments fail in ways that were not expected.  \n",
    "3. **Future extensibility is a problem** – If we add more payment types, we might introduce more unexpected failures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Your Task**  \n",
    "✅ **Refactor the code** to ensure that all `PaymentProcessor` subclasses **can be substituted without breaking the system**.  \n",
    "✅ **Ensure each subclass correctly implements `process_payment()`** without throwing unexpected exceptions.  \n",
    "✅ **If extra steps (like verification) are needed**, they should be handled properly within the class rather than breaking the expected flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✔️ Expected Improvements**   \n",
    "\n",
    "To refactor the existing code while maintaining **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**, follow these steps:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensure Consistent Behavior Across Subclasses**  \n",
    "   - Every subclass should properly implement the `process_payment(amount)` method.  \n",
    "   - **It should never throw unexpected exceptions** when called.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handle Special Cases Within the Class**  \n",
    "   - The `CryptoProcessor` currently throws an exception because it needs additional verification.  \n",
    "   - Instead of breaking the expected behavior, **handle extra verification within the class itself**.  \n",
    "   - For example, you could introduce a **`verify_transaction()` method** inside the `CryptoProcessor` class to handle extra verification **before** processing the payment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use a Common Interface**  \n",
    "   - The `PaymentProcessor` should define a **clear contract** for all subclasses.  \n",
    "   - Each subclass should implement `process_payment()` in a way that does **not change the expected behavior** of a payment processor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Expected Usage After Refactoring  \n",
    "\n",
    "After refactoring, the system should be able to process payments **without requiring changes to the client code**. The usage should look like this:  \n",

    "## 🔹 Final Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** is a crucial part of writing scalable, maintainable, and extensible software. By ensuring that **subclasses can replace their base classes without unexpected behavior**, we build systems that are **more predictable, reusable, and easier to extend**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the **payment processing example**, refactoring the code to follow LSP made it easier to **add new payment methods** without breaking existing functionality. This approach improves **code reusability** and **maintainability**, reducing the risk of unexpected failures in real-world applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Interview Perspective  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "✅ **Demonstrates understanding of inheritance and polymorphism** – You should know when **inheritance is appropriate** and when it **violates LSP**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Shows problem-solving ability in real-world scenarios** – Many interview problems involve **refactoring poorly designed code**. Your ability to **identify issues and improve design** using LSP can set you apart.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Avoids breaking changes in large-scale systems** – Companies want engineers who can **design systems that scale**. LSP ensures **new features can be added without modifying existing code**, which is a key principle in enterprise software development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 How to Prepare for Interviews\n",
    "- **Practice identifying LSP violations** in different codebases.  \n",
    "- **Refactor existing code** to ensure substitutability without breaking functionality.  \n",
    "- **Discuss trade-offs in design decisions** – Sometimes, using **composition over inheritance** is a better alternative.  \n",
