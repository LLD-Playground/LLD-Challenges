    "# 📖 Strategy Design Pattern - Simple Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Strategy Design Pattern** is a way to **define a family of behaviors (algorithms)**, put them in separate classes, and make them **interchangeable**. This pattern allows a class to change its behavior **at runtime** without modifying its code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need the Strategy Pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications, we often write **large `if-else` or `switch` statements** to handle different behaviors. This makes the code **harder to maintain** and violates the **Open Closed Principle (OCP)** because adding a new behavior requires modifying existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Strategy Pattern** helps solve this problem by **encapsulating each behavior in a separate class** and making it easy to swap behaviors dynamically."

    "### Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚨 Problem 1: Violates Open-Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 **Issue**: If we need to add a new payment method, we have to **modify the `Checkout` class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Let's say we introduce **Cryptocurrency Payments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if method == \"credit_card\":\n",
    "    print(f\"Processing ${amount} payment via Credit Card\")\n",
    "elif method == \"paypal\":\n",
    "    print(f\"Processing ${amount} payment via PayPal\")\n",
    "elif method == \"bank_transfer\":\n",
    "    print(f\"Processing ${amount} payment via Bank Transfer\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "elif method == \"crypto\":\n",
    "    print(f\"Processing ${amount} payment via Cryptocurrency\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 **Problem**: Every time we add a new payment method, we must modify the existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡ **This violates the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), which states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚨 Problem 2: Hard to Maintain & Prone to Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 **Issue**: If multiple developers work on this file and someone accidentally modifies an existing `if-else` block, it might **break existing functionality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a developer mistakenly removes a **payment method** while adding a new one:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if method == \"credit_card\":\n",
    "    print(f\"Processing ${amount} payment via Credit Card\")\n",
    "elif method == \"paypal\":\n",
    "    print(f\"Processing ${amount} payment via PayPal\")\n",
    "# Removed bank_transfer by mistake\n",
    "elif method == \"crypto\":\n",
    "    print(f\"Processing ${amount} payment via Cryptocurrency\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🚨 **Problem**: We accidentally removed Bank Transfer, breaking the feature!\n",
    "\n",
    "➡ **The more conditions we add, the harder it becomes to maintain.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚨 Problem 3: Not Scalable\n",

    "🔴 **Issue**: The `Checkout` class **does too many things**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It handles logic for processing payments.\n",
    "* It decides which payment method to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If tomorrow, we introduce **multiple checkout flows** (e.g., international vs. domestic transactions), this class will become **even more bloated**.\n",

    "### Detailed Analysis (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the **Strategy Design Pattern**, we significantly improve our code in the following ways:  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ Open-Closed Principle (OCP) – No Need to Modify Existing Code\n",
    "🚨 **Problem in Bad Code:**  \n",
    "- If we need to add a new payment method, we **must edit the existing `Checkout` class**.  \n",
    "- This means **more risk**, a small mistake could break existing functionality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **How Strategy Pattern Fixes This:**  \n",
    "- Each payment method is placed in **a separate class**.  \n",
    "- If we need to **add a new payment method**, we **create a new class** instead of modifying existing code.  \n",
    "- **Existing code remains untouched, reducing chances of breaking the system.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Adding **Cryptocurrency Payment** is as simple as writing:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CryptoPayment(PaymentStrategy):\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):\n",
    "        print(f\"Processing ${amount} payment via Cryptocurrency\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "💡 **No changes needed in `Checkout`!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2️⃣ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) – Cleaner & Maintainable Code\n",
    "🚨 **Problem in Bad Code:**  \n",
    "- The `Checkout` class **handles multiple things**:  \n",
    "  - Choosing a payment method  \n",
    "  - Processing payments  \n",
    "  - Managing different conditions (`if-else`)  \n",
    "- This makes the class **bloated** and difficult to maintain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **How Strategy Pattern Fixes This:**  \n",
    "- Each payment method **has its own class**, following the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.  \n",
    "- The `Checkout` class **only** processes payments—it does not care about the payment method’s details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Checkout:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, payment_strategy: PaymentStrategy):\n",
    "        self.payment_strategy = payment_strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "    def process_payment(self, amount):\n",
    "        self.payment_strategy.pay(amount)\n",
    "```\n",
    "💡 **Now, the `Checkout` class is cleaner and easier to manage.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3️⃣ No More Giant `if-else` Statements – Improved Readability \n",
    "🚨 **Problem in Bad Code:**  \n",
    "- As we add more payment methods, our `if-else` block **keeps growing**.  \n",
    "- If we have **10+ payment methods**, the function becomes **unreadable and error-prone**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **How Strategy Pattern Fixes This:**  \n",
    "- No need for **if-else conditions** in `Checkout`.  \n",
    "- The class **only calls the selected strategy**, making the code **concise and easy to read**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4️⃣ Scalability – Easily Add or Swap Payment Methods\n",
    "🚨 **Problem in Bad Code:**  \n",
    "- If we need to add **a seasonal payment method** (e.g., “Holiday Discount Payment”), we must **modify the core checkout logic**.  \n",
    "- This **is not scalable** in large applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **How Strategy Pattern Fixes This:**  \n",
    "- New payment methods can be added **without modifying existing classes**.  \n",
    "- We can **dynamically swap** payment methods at runtime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "checkout = Checkout(CreditCardPayment())  \n",
    "checkout.process_payment(100)  # Processing $100 via Credit Card  \n",
    "\n",
    "checkout = Checkout(CryptoPayment())  \n",
    "checkout.process_payment(200)  # Processing $200 via Cryptocurrency  \n",
    "```\n",
    "💡 **We can switch payment methods at runtime without changing `Checkout`!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5️⃣ Easier Unit Testing – Test Payment Methods Independently\n",
    "🚨 **Problem in Bad Code:**  \n",
    "- The `Checkout` class handles all logic, making it **harder to test** payment methods individually.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **How Strategy Pattern Fixes This:**  \n",
    "- We can test **each payment method separately**.  \n",
    "- If something breaks, we immediately know which class is faulty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_credit_card_payment():\n",
    "    payment = CreditCardPayment()\n",
    "    assert payment.pay(100) == \"Processing $100 payment via Credit Card\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "💡 **Now, tests are isolated and simpler to debug!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6️⃣ Supports Dependency Injection – More Flexibility\n",
    "🚨 **Problem in Bad Code:**  \n",
    "- The `Checkout` class is **tightly coupled** to all payment methods.  \n",
    "- This makes it **hard to change behaviors dynamically**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **How Strategy Pattern Fixes This:**  \n",
    "- The payment strategy is **injected dynamically** into `Checkout`.  \n",
    "- This means we can **configure payment methods via a settings file or user input**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "payment_method = user_selected_payment_method()  # User chooses PayPal\n",
    "checkout = Checkout(payment_method)  \n",
    "checkout.process_payment(150)\n",
    "```\n",
    "💡 **Users can choose or change payment methods dynamically!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📌 Final Takeaway – Why Use Strategy Pattern?\n",
    "✅ **Modular Code** – Each strategy is **self-contained** and easy to manage.  \n",
    "✅ **Extensible** – Add new behaviors **without modifying existing code**.  \n",
    "✅ **Scalable** – Works well for systems with multiple strategies.  \n",
    "✅ **Testable** – Each strategy can be **independently tested**.  \n",
    "✅ **Flexible** – Change behaviors **at runtime** without modifying core logic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why **Strategy Pattern** is a **powerful design pattern** for handling multiple behaviors in a clean, scalable, and maintainable way! 🚀\n",

    "## 🎯 Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By refactoring the **Shape Drawing System** using the **Strategy Design Pattern**, we have achieved a **scalable, maintainable, and extensible** architecture. The new implementation eliminates **tight coupling** and follows **SOLID principles**, particularly:  \n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – Each shape class is now responsible only for its own behavior.  \n",
    "✔ **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** – New shapes can be added **without modifying existing code**.  \n",
    "✔ **Strategy Pattern** – The shape-drawing logic is encapsulated into interchangeable strategies, making the system **flexible**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is particularly useful in **real-world applications** where multiple behaviors need to be selected dynamically, such as:  \n",
    "- **Payment processing** (different payment methods like credit card, PayPal, and crypto).  \n",
    "- **Sorting algorithms** (switching between QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.).  \n",
    "- **Recommendation systems** (applying different filtering techniques).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Interview Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Strategy Pattern** is a **common design pattern** asked in **Low-Level Design (LLD) interviews**, especially for **scalable and extensible architecture** problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Why interviewers love this pattern?**  \n",
    "- It **tests your ability** to write **maintainable** and **extensible** code.  \n",
    "- It evaluates your understanding of **polymorphism, encapsulation, and dependency injection**.  \n",
