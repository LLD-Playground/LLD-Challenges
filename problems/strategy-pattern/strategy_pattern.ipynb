    "# üìñ Strategy Design Pattern - Simple Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Strategy Design Pattern** is a way to **define a family of behaviors (algorithms)**, put them in separate classes, and make them **interchangeable**. This pattern allows a class to change its behavior **at runtime** without modifying its code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need the Strategy Pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications, we often write **large `if-else` or `switch` statements** to handle different behaviors. This makes the code **harder to maintain** and violates the **Open Closed Principle (OCP)** because adding a new behavior requires modifying existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Strategy Pattern** helps solve this problem by **encapsulating each behavior in a separate class** and making it easy to swap behaviors dynamically."

    "‚úî **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** ‚Äì New shapes can be added **without modifying existing code**.  \n",
    "‚úî **Strategy Pattern** ‚Äì The shape-drawing logic is encapsulated into interchangeable strategies, making the system **flexible**.  \n",

    "- **Sorting algorithms** (switching between QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.).  \n",
    "- **Recommendation systems** (applying different filtering techniques).  \n",
